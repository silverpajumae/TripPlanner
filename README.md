# TripPlanner 

The project is to develop a trip planner. The trip planner takes as
input a public transportation schedule of a given city (e.g. city of
Tallinn) and allows a user of the public transportation system to find a
route from one stop to the other. The user specifies as a minimum the
departure stop, their departure date and (approximate) departure time,
and the destination stop. The user wants to see which transportation
line she should take first at the departure stop, and at what time they
should take the transportation line; where they should change
transportation line (if any transfers are needed); and at what time they
will reach the destination stop.
